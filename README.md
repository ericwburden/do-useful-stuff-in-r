# Do Useful Stuff in R!

This project is intended to house a collection of learning materials directed primarily at new R learners, especially those who may be engaged in data analysis and reporting work using primarily no-code/low-code tools. For these folks, R represents the potential for significant productivity and reproducibility gains.

At present, the project contains an R Shiny application to deploy a series of [`learnr`](<https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/>) tutorials, but I have plans to expand the project with additional learning materials, presentations, sample projects, etc. over time.
